# Contributing to Sleep Blocker MCP Server

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Sleep Blocker MCP Server as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## üöÄ Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## üìã Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Add tests** if you've added code that should be tested
3. **Update documentation** if you've changed APIs
4. **Ensure the test suite passes**
5. **Make sure your code follows** the existing style
6. **Issue the pull request**!

## üêõ Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/SleepBlocker-MCP/issues).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## üí° Feature Requests

We use GitHub issues to track feature requests as well. Create a feature request by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/SleepBlocker-MCP/issues) with the "enhancement" label.

## üéØ Development Setup

1. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SleepBlocker-MCP.git
   cd SleepBlocker-MCP
   ```

2. **Make the server executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x mcp_server.py
   ```

3. **Test the server:**
   ```bash
   echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "initialize", "params": {}}' | python3 mcp_server.py
   ```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test server initialization
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "initialize", "params": {}}' | python3 mcp_server.py

# Test tools listing
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "tools/list", "params": {}}' | python3 mcp_server.py

# Test tool execution
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 3, "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "get_sleep_status", "arguments": {}}}' | python3 mcp_server.py
```

### Integration Testing
- Test with Claude Code
- Test with other MCP clients
- Test on different macOS versions
- Test with different Python versions (3.7+)

## üìù Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle errors gracefully with helpful error messages

### Code Examples

**Good:**
```python
async def start_sleep_prevention(mode: str = "idle", duration_minutes: Optional[int] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Start preventing system sleep with specified mode and duration."""
    try:
        # Implementation here
        return {"success": True, "message": "Sleep prevention started"}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
```

**Bad:**
```python
def start(m="idle", d=None):
    # No docstring, unclear parameters
    cmd = ["/usr/bin/caffeinate"] + get_args(m)
    # No error handling
```

## üé® Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include practical examples
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes
- Use emoji consistently but sparingly
- Follow the existing documentation structure

## üö¶ Issue Labels

We use these labels to categorize issues:

- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or request
- `documentation` - Improvements or additions to documentation
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention is needed
- `question` - Further information is requested
- `wontfix` - This will not be worked on

## üéØ Areas for Contribution

### High Priority
- **Error handling improvements** - Better error messages and recovery
- **Performance optimization** - Reduce memory usage and startup time
- **Cross-platform support** - Adapt for other Unix systems (though macOS-focused)
